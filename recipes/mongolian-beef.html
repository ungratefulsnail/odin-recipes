      <h3><em>The soul of Asia in a skillet</em></h3>
      <p>This Mongolian beef recipe with green onions has a soy-based sauce for a Chinese-style beef dish. Best served over soft rice noodles or rice.</p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon grated fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>⅔ cup dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>1 pound beef flank steak, sliced 1/4 inch thick on the diagonal</li>
        <li>¼ cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>2 bunches green onions, cut in 2-inch lengths</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and ginger; cook and stir until fragrant, <strong>about 30 seconds</strong>.</li>
        <li>Stir in brown sugar, soy sauce, and water.</li>
        <li>Increase heat to medium-high; stir until sauce boils and slightly thickens, <strong>about 4 minutes</strong>. Remove sauce from the heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Place beef into a large bowl; add cornstarch and mix until beef is thoroughly coated.</li>
        <li>Set aside until most of the cornstarch has been absorbed, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a deep skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Shake excess cornstarch from beef slices and drop into hot oil, a few at a time, stirring briefly and frying until edges become crisp, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove beef with a large slotted spoon; drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Remove excess oil from the skillet, then heat the skillet over medium heat; add beef slices and stir in prepared sauce. Add green onions and bring to a boil; cook until the onions have just softened and are bright green, about 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
